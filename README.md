Intro:
COVID-19 barged its way onto the world stage earlier this year and has fundamentally altered all of our daily lives.
Every day we are flooded with news of climbing global infection rates and mounting death tolls. According to
behavior psychologist Michael Mazius, Ph.D., we have become accustomed to the pandemic “to the point of
habituation and even desensitization”.
Despite this “COVID fatigue”, we are not out of this crisis yet. For the sakes of our friends and families, it is
important to remain diligent in practicing safety measures. This case is intended to explore the more immediate
impact of this virus on our local Austin community.

Task:
Predict the growth of infections for this holiday season (Thanksgiving Nov 26th
– New Year’s Jan 1st) within
Greater Austin.
- Greater Austin is roughly defined as the Austin Metropolitan Area – Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays, Travis, and
Williamson Counties.
- Any credible datasets are available for use but at least one major source needs to be from a .gov website.
Eg:
  o https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_totalcases
  o https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/additionaldata.aspx
  o External datasets are allowed.

This is an open-ended prompt that allows for various methods of analysis and presentation. Some potential ideas to
help guide your thinking include but are certainly not limited to: examining the rise in influenza infection rates
during the holiday season and to scale it accordingly to COVID-19, researching the amount of daily in-store
shoppers at various stores, etc.

You are free to use all tools at your disposal which include but are not limited to: Excel, RStudio, MATLAB,
Tableau, Python SciPy.

For finals round only: Be prepared to refute potential arguments against your prediction during live Q&A.
Guidelines and Expectations:
  o Statistical Approach
  o How was the data selected? Where was it selected from? Why is this source credible? (particularly
  relevant for external sources)
  o What statistical tests were run and were there any key assumptions made?
    ▪ Clear evidence or reasoning for assumptions/factors included in your argument
    ▪ Complexity of statistical tests is a relatively minor factor in grading
  o Data
  o Demonstration of analysis with raw data will score more points than simply referencing statistics from previous research findings or online articles
  o All data and statistics used must have sources and/or reasoning to back them up
  o Presentation
  o Use of figures, graphs, and/or charts to illustrate findings
  o Professionalism
  o Organized and clear presentation
  o Judge Panel Q/A (Finals Round only)
